In src:
    domain.Device.java
    domain.DeviceDetails.java
    domain.Location.java

These three files are our "mapping" tools and how we want
to receive our data.


I was able to come up with the objects/tables
that we want to map our device data onto. Apis are
relatively still new to me, so I was unsure about a
lot of things I learned about online and didn't want
to directly copy code.
